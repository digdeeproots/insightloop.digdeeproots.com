# Insight Loop Workshop from Code by Refactoring

## Intention

We want you to run this workshop for others, including within companies. In fact, that's where it would be most useful!

Additionally, we've found a bunch of ways to teach this material that don't work. We want Code by Refactoring to mean something---to be effective. Our facilitator guide shows you a way to do it that will work, even with normal variation. We want people to generally follow that guide, so that they will teach something that works.

This license is an attempt to meet these intentions. If you feel it does not meet our intention, please contact [legal@digdeeproots.com](mailto:legal@digdeeproots.com). We would be happy to consider recommendations.
